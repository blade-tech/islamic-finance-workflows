## Notes and Observations

1. **AAOIFI Integration**: QFCRA heavily relies on AAOIFI standards, particularly:
   - GSIFI No. 1 (Shariah Supervisory Board)
   - GSIFI No. 2 (Shariah Review)
   - GSIFI No. 3 (Internal Shariah Review)
   - FAS 12 & 13 (Insurance disclosures)

2. **Principles-Based Approach**: Many requirements are principles-based rather than prescriptive, allowing flexibility in implementation while maintaining high standards.

3. **Gaps Identified**:
   - Explicit SNCR reporting requirements not detailed
   - Purification procedures not specified
   - Digital/blockchain evidence standards not addressed
   - ESG/sustainability reporting not mandated (though may be coming per recent consultations)

4. **Recent Developments**:
   - Operational Risk and Resilience rules significantly updated in 2024
   - SSB requirements being consolidated in CTRL (removing duplication from IBANK)

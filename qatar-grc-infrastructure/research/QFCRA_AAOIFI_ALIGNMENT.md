## Qatar-Specific Deviations

### Areas Where QFCRA Deviates from or Enhances AAOIFI

#### 1. Capital Adequacy Framework
- **QFCRA Approach**: Follows Basel III/IFSB framework
- **AAOIFI Position**: Has separate capital adequacy standards
- **Resolution**: QFCRA requirements prevail for prudential matters

#### 2. Risk Management
- **QFCRA Approach**: Comprehensive risk framework in CTRL
- **AAOIFI Position**: GS 14 provides high-level principles
- **Resolution**: QFCRA more prescriptive and detailed

#### 3. Liquidity Management
- **QFCRA Approach**: LCR and NSFR per Basel III
- **AAOIFI Position**: Different liquidity approach
- **Resolution**: QFCRA requirements mandatory

#### 4. Operational Risk
- **QFCRA Approach**: Detailed operational risk framework (CTRL Chapter 8)
- **AAOIFI Position**: Limited operational risk guidance
- **Resolution**: QFCRA requirements more comprehensive

#### 5. Record Retention
- **QFCRA Requirement**: 6 years for SSB records (ISFI 6.1.3)
- **AAOIFI Standard**: No specific retention period
- **Resolution**: QFCRA's 6-year requirement applies

#### 6. Reporting Deadlines
- **QFCRA Requirement**: SSB report within 3 months (ISFI 6.2.2)
- **AAOIFI Standard**: No specific deadline
- **Resolution**: QFCRA's timeline mandatory

#### 7. SSB Minimum Size
- **QFCRA Requirement**: Minimum 3 members (ISFI 6.1.1)
- **AAOIFI Standard**: Minimum 3 members (aligned)
- **Resolution**: Full alignment

#### 8. Islamic Windows
- **QFCRA Approach**: Only insurance windows allowed (ISFI 8.1.2)
- **AAOIFI Position**: Allows various types of windows
- **Resolution**: QFCRA restriction applies in QFC

## Conflict Resolution

### Hierarchy of Requirements

When conflicts arise between QFCRA and AAOIFI requirements, the following hierarchy applies:

1. **QFC Law** - Supreme authority
2. **QFCRA Regulations** - Take precedence
3. **QFCRA Rules** (ISFI, IBANK, CTRL) - Mandatory compliance
4. **AAOIFI Standards** - Where explicitly referenced in rules
5. **Industry Best Practice** - Where not specified

### Resolution Mechanisms

#### 1. Regulatory Supremacy
- QFCRA requirements always override AAOIFI where conflicts exist
- Prudential requirements (capital, liquidity, risk) follow Basel/IFSB

#### 2. Shariah Matters
- SSB has authority on pure Shariah interpretations
- Must still comply with QFCRA governance requirements
- Can be stricter than AAOIFI but not more lenient than QFCRA

#### 3. Accounting Treatment
- IFRS is the base framework in QFC
- AAOIFI FAS supplements for Islamic-specific items
- Where both address same issue, institution chooses most appropriate

#### 4. Disclosure Requirements
- Must meet both QFCRA and AAOIFI disclosure requirements
- Additional disclosure preferred over less disclosure
- Transparency principle prevails

---

## Integration Approach

### How QFCRA Incorporates AAOIFI

#### 1. Direct Reference
**Method**: Explicit requirement to comply with specific AAOIFI standard
**Examples**:
- GSIFI No. 1 for SSB reports (ISFI 6.2.2)
- GSIFI No. 2 for Shariah reviews (ISFI 6.2.1)
- GSIFI No. 3 for internal reviews (ISFI 6.3.2)
- FAS 12 & 13 for insurance disclosures (ISFI 3.1.3)

#### 2. Principles Alignment
**Method**: QFCRA rules embody AAOIFI principles without explicit reference
**Examples**:
- SSB independence requirements align with GS 5
- Shariah compliance function aligns with GS 18
- Governance requirements align with GS 17

#### 3. Selective Adoption
**Method**: Choose specific elements while maintaining own framework
**Examples**:
- SSB structure follows AAOIFI but reporting deadlines are QFCRA-specific
- Risk management incorporates AAOIFI principles within Basel framework

#### 4. Industry Practice Incorporation
**Method**: Market participants voluntarily adopt AAOIFI standards
**Examples**:
- Shariah standards for product structures
- Accounting standards for Islamic instruments
- Audit approaches for Shariah compliance

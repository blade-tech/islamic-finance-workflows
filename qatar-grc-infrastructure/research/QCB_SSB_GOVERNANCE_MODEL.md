# Qatar Central Bank (QCB) Shariah Supervisory Board Governance Model

## Executive Summary

QCB implements a **dual-layer Shariah governance model** combining entity-level Shariah Supervisory Boards (SSBs) with regulatory oversight, though **notably lacks a formal Central Shariah Board** unlike some other jurisdictions.

## Absence of Central Shariah Board

### Current Structure
Unlike some jurisdictions (UAE, Malaysia), Qatar does **NOT** have a formal Central Shariah Board at QCB level.

### Implications
1. **Autonomy**: Each bank's SSB has final authority
2. **Variation**: Potential for different interpretations
3. **Innovation**: More flexibility for product development
4. **Challenges**: Lack of standardization

### Coordination Mechanisms
Despite no central board, coordination achieved through:
- AAOIFI standards adoption
- QCB regulatory oversight
- Industry forums and conferences
- Informal SSB member networks

## Comparison with QFCRA Model

| Aspect | QCB Model | QFCRA Model |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **SSB Requirement** | Mandatory | Mandatory |
| **Minimum Size** | 3 members | 3 members |
| **Central Board** | None | None |
| **AAOIFI Alignment** | Mandatory | Referenced |
| **Reporting** | To Board and QCB | To Board and QFCRA |
| **Product Approval** | SSB authority | SSB authority |
| **Enforcement** | Direct QCB oversight | Principles-based |

## Key Obligations for Islamic Banks

- **OBL-QCB-SSB-001**: Establish SSB with minimum 3 qualified members
- **OBL-QCB-SSB-002**: Ensure SSB independence and reporting to Board
- **OBL-QCB-SSB-003**: Provide adequate resources and support to SSB
- **OBL-QCB-SSB-004**: Implement SSB decisions without delay

### 2. Operational Obligations
- **OBL-QCB-SSB-005**: Obtain SSB approval for all new products
- **OBL-QCB-SSB-006**: Submit annual Shariah compliance report
- **OBL-QCB-SSB-007**: Maintain Shariah compliance function

## Best Practices and Recommendations

### For Islamic Banks
1. **Strengthen SSB Independence**
   - Clear charter and terms of reference
   - Regular performance evaluations
   - Continuous professional development
   - Succession planning

2. **Enhance Internal Functions**
   - Robust Shariah compliance unit
   - Integrated risk management
   - Technology-enabled monitoring
   - Comprehensive training programs

3. **Improve Transparency**
   - Detailed SSB reports
   - Product approval disclosures
   - SNCR incident reporting
   - Stakeholder engagement

### For Regulators
1. Consider establishing Central Shariah Board for:
   - Standardization of products
   - Resolution of complex issues
   - Industry-wide guidance
   - International coordination

2. Enhance regulatory framework:
   - Detailed SSB governance standards
   - Shariah audit requirements
   - Competency frameworks
   - Enforcement mechanisms

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Current Challenges
1. **Lack of standardization** across banks
2. **Limited pool** of qualified SSB members
3. **Potential conflicts** in multiple appointments
4. **Cost and complexity** of compliance

### Future Opportunities
1. **Technology adoption** for Shariah compliance
2. **Professional certification** programs
3. **Regional harmonization** initiatives
4. **Innovation** in governance models

## Conclusion

QCB's Shariah governance model emphasizes **entity-level autonomy** within a **regulated framework**. While the absence of a Central Shariah Board provides flexibility, it also creates challenges for standardization. The comprehensive requirements for SSBs, combined with mandatory AAOIFI adoption, create a robust but decentralized Shariah governance system.

The model works well for Qatar's relatively small number of Islamic banks but may need evolution as the industry grows and becomes more complex.

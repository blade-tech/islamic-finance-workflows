## Decision Needed

❓ **Do we build real agents or mock for demo?**

**Recommendation**: Mock for 4-week demo, validate with sales, then build real if traction.

**Rationale**:
- Delve raised $32M *after* proving concept with 500+ customers
- Vanta shipped AI after becoming unicorn
- We should validate "AI-native GRC for Islamic finance" thesis first

---

**TL;DR**: The market is going agentic (Delve, Vanta prove it). We can win with **Islamic finance specialization + blockchain proofs**. Build 4-week demo, validate with sales, then productionize if we get traction.
